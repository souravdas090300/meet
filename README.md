## ✅ Scenarios (Gherkin Syntax)

### Feature 1: Filter Events by City 🎯

```gherkin
Scenario: Show events from all cities when no search
Given the user opens the app
When the user hasn’t searched for a city
Then show events from all cities

Scenario: Auto-suggestions when typing city
Given the user types in the city search box
Then a list of matching suggestions should be shown

Scenario: Selecting city filters events
Given the user selects a city from suggestions
Then show only events from that city
```

---

### Feature 2: Show/Hide Event Details

```gherkin
Scenario: Event details hidden by default
Given user opens the app
Then each event shows only basic info

Scenario: Expand event details
When user clicks "Show Details"
Then show detailed event info

Scenario: Collapse event details
When user clicks "Hide Details"
Then hide the extra info
```

---

### Feature 3: Specify Number of Events

```gherkin
Scenario: Show 32 events by default
When user opens the app
Then 32 events are shown

Scenario: User inputs a number
When a valid number is entered
Then show that many events

Scenario: Invalid number entered
Then show an error and revert to previous value
```

---

### Feature 4: Offline Usage

```gherkin
Scenario: Show cached events when offline
Given user used app before
Then show previously loaded events offline

Scenario: First time use with no connection
Then show error and prompt for internet

Scenario: Sync when back online
When connection is restored
Then fetch latest events automatically
```

---

### Feature 5: Install as PWA

```gherkin
Scenario: "Add to Home Screen" option appears
When user visits on a compatible browser
Then browser shows install prompt

Scenario: App added to home screen
Then app opens in standalone mode
```

---

### Feature 6: Charts Visualization

```gherkin
Scenario: Show scatterplot chart of events per city
Given the user opens the app
When events are loaded
Then user sees a scatterplot showing event count by city
And the chart displays city names on X-axis
And the chart displays event count on Y-axis
And tooltips show detailed information on hover

Scenario: Show pie chart of event genres
Given the user opens the app  
When events are loaded
Then user sees a pie chart showing event distribution by genre
And each slice represents a different technology (React, JavaScript, Node, jQuery, Angular)
And percentages are displayed on each slice
And a legend shows color coding for each genre

Scenario: Responsive chart display
Given the user views charts on different screen sizes
When the screen width is larger than 768px
Then charts display side-by-side in a grid layout
When the screen width is smaller than 768px  
Then charts stack vertically for mobile viewing

Scenario: Interactive chart features
When user hovers over chart elements
Then tooltips display detailed information
And chart elements highlight appropriately
And smooth animations enhance the user experience
```
