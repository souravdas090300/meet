# Meet App - Complete Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. React Error #130 (Element type invalid)
- **Root Cause**: Duplicate imports and exports in App.jsx
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed duplicate import statements
  - Removed duplicate export statements
  - Changed component from arrow function to function declaration for better compatibility

### 2. Service Worker Registration Errors
- **Root Cause**: Service worker trying to register with incorrect paths (`/meet/sw.js`)
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated service worker registration to use correct path (`/sw.js`)
  - Modified service worker to handle dynamic asset caching
  - Added proper error handling for missing resources
  - Made registration conditional (production only)

### 3. Manifest.json Syntax Errors
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect paths and potential encoding issues
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated all icon paths to remove `/meet/` prefix
  - Ensured clean JSON formatting without BOM characters
  - Corrected start_url to use root path

### 4. Vercel Deployment Configuration
- **Root Cause**: Vercel config pointing to wrong build directory and using incorrect paths
- **Fix**: 
  - Changed `distDir` from `build` to `dist` (Vite default)
  - Updated routing to handle assets correctly
  - Removed hardcoded `/meet/` path references

### 5. Build System Migration
- **Root Cause**: Mixed Create React App and Vite configurations
- **Fix**: 
  - Completely migrated to Vite
  - Updated package.json dependencies
  - Removed react-scripts
  - Added proper Vite plugins and configuration

### 6. Entry Point Issues
- **Root Cause**: Conflicting index.js and main.jsx files
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed index.js
  - Made main.jsx the single entry point
  - Updated HTML to reference correct entry point

## Files Modified

1. **src/App.jsx** - Fixed duplicate imports/exports, changed to function declaration
2. **src/main.jsx** - Clean entry point with proper service worker registration
3. **public/sw.js** - Updated service worker with dynamic caching
4. **public/manifest.json** - Fixed paths and formatting
5. **package.json** - Migrated to Vite, updated scripts and dependencies
6. **vercel.json** - Fixed deployment configuration
7. **vite.config.js** - Removed base path configuration
8. **index.html** - Updated to use correct asset paths

## Deployment Steps

1. Commit all changes to git
2. Push to GitHub repository
3. Vercel will automatically rebuild and deploy
4. The app should now work without React errors or service worker issues

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Development server runs without errors (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ Production build completes successfully (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Production preview works correctly (`npm run preview`)
- ✅ No React error #130 in production
- ✅ Service worker registers correctly in production
- ✅ Manifest.json loads without syntax errors
- ✅ All components render properly
- ✅ Event data loads from mock-data

## Additional Notes

- The app now uses Vite instead of Create React App for better performance
- Service worker only registers in production builds
- All paths are now relative to the root domain
- The build outputs to `dist/` directory as expected by Vercel
