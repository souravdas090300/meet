### Issue 2: Vercel Deployment MIME Type Errors - ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: Vercel app failing with "Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of 'text/html'"
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 
  - ✅ **IDENTIFIED**: Incorrect routing in `vercel.json` was serving HTML for all requests including JS/CSS files
  - Base path configuration in `vite.config.js` was set to `/meet/` (for GitHub Pages) but Vercel needs `/`
  - Over-aggressive catch-all route was intercepting asset requests
- **Solution Applied**: 
  1. ✅ **Fixed Vercel Routing**: Updated `vercel.json` to properly serve static assets before fallback to index.html
  2. ✅ **Environment-Specific Base Path**: Modified `vite.config.js` to use `/` for Vercel and `/meet/` for GitHub Pages
  3. ✅ **Asset Path Resolution**: Ensured proper routing for `/assets/*` and static file extensions
  4. ✅ **Rebuilt and Deployed**: Pushed changes to trigger new Vercel deployment with correct paths
- **Technical Details**: 
  - **Old Route**: `"src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html"` caught everything
  - **New Route**: Added specific patterns for static files before catch-all
  - **Base Path**: Now uses `process.env.VERCEL ? '/' : '/meet/'` for environment detection
- **Verification**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Vercel deployment successful, both GitHub Pages and Vercel now working correctly
