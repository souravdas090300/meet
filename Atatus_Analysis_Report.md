  1. ‚úÖ **Enhanced Environment Check**: Changed to `import.meta.env.DEV && window.location.hostname === 'localhost'`
  2. ‚úÖ **Deployed Fix**: New production build deployed without test errors
  3. ‚úÖ **Error Source Identified**: Found exact location in minified bundle
  4. ‚úÖ **Production Cleaned**: Removed all test errors from production environment
  5. ‚úÖ **Branch Management**: Fixed Git repository issues and properly merged gh-pages branch
- **Verification**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Monitor tomorrow's daily report for improved error rate (should drop to near 0%)

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Check Specific Error Messages**: Login to Atatus dashboard and examine individual error messages
2. **Browser Testing**: Test app across different browsers to identify browser-specific issues
3. **Network Testing**: Test app with slow/limited network connections
4. **API Error Handling**: Consider implementing retry logic for Google Calendar API calls

### Issue 2: Vercel Deployment MIME Type Errors - ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: Vercel app failing with "Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of 'text/html'"
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 
  - ‚úÖ **IDENTIFIED**: Incorrect routing in `vercel.json` was serving HTML for all requests including JS/CSS files
  - Base path configuration in `vite.config.js` was set to `/meet/` (for GitHub Pages) but Vercel needs `/`
  - Over-aggressive catch-all route was intercepting asset requests
- **Solution Applied**: 
  1. ‚úÖ **Fixed Vercel Routing**: Updated `vercel.json` to properly serve static assets before fallback to index.html
  2. ‚úÖ **Environment-Specific Base Path**: Modified `vite.config.js` to use `/` for Vercel and `/meet/` for GitHub Pages
  3. ‚úÖ **Asset Path Resolution**: Ensured proper routing for `/assets/*` and static file extensions
  4. ‚úÖ **Rebuilt and Deployed**: Pushed changes to trigger new Vercel deployment with correct paths
- **Technical Details**: 
  - **Old Route**: `"src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html"` caught everything
  - **New Route**: Added specific patterns for static files before catch-all
  - **Base Path**: Now uses `process.env.VERCEL ? '/' : '/meet/'` for environment detection
- **Verification**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Vercel deployment successful, both GitHub Pages and Vercel now working correctly
